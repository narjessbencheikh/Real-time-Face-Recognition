A Real-time face recognition systems using OpenCV and Python. It utilizes a pre-trained face detection model to identify faces in live video streams captured from a webcam.

The objective of this project is to develop a system that can identify people in real-time using a webcam and recognize who they are. It achieves this by:
1- Capturing video frames from a webcam.
2- Detecting faces within each frame using OpenCV, an open-source library for computer vision.
3- Comparing the detected faces to a pre-existing database of known faces (likely containing images and names of individuals).
4- Identifying the person and displaying their information (e.g., name) on the screen if a match is found in the database.

Overall, this project offers a practical demonstration of real-time face recognition, suitable for applications such as surveillance, security, or entertainment.
